(1) In the name of Allāh,[2] the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.[3] 

(2) [All] praise is [due] to Allāh, Lord[4] of the worlds - 

(3) The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful, 

(4) Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.[5] 
(5) It is You we worship and You we ask for help. 
(6) Guide us to the straight path - 

(7) The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have earned [Your] anger or of those who are astray. 
(1) Alif, Lām, Meem.[7]

(2) This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allāh[8] 

(3) Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer,[9] and spend out of what We[10] have provided for them,

(4) And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith]. 
(5) Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful. 
(6) Indeed, those who disbelieve[11] - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe. 
(7) Allāh has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil.[12] And for them is a great punishment.

(8) And of the people are some who say, "We believe in Allāh and the Last Day," but they are not believers. 
(9) They [think to] deceive Allāh and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

(10) In their hearts is disease, so Allāh has increased their disease;[13] and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.

(11) And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the earth," they say, "We are but reformers."

(12) Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not. 

(13) And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not. 

(14) And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers." 

(15) [But] Allāh mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.

(16) Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.

(17) Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allāh took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see. 

(18) Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].

(19) Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allāh is encompassing[14] of the disbelievers. 

(20) The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allāh had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allāh is over all things competent. 

(21) O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous - 

(22) [He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allāh equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him]. 


(23) And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down [i.e., the Qur’ān] upon Our Servant [i.e., Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)], then produce a sūrah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses [i.e., supporters] other than Allāh, if you should be truthful. 


(24) But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers. 


(25) And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, "This is what we were provided with before." And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.
